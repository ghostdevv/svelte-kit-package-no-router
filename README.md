# Svelte Kit package without router

This is an example of how you can use `svelte-kit package` without any of the routing features.

# Why?

While I personally use the routing solution as documentation or testing for my package where I can, in some cases you just don't want it. For example on sites where I make my documentation in something like [Routify](https://routify.dev), or when you just need it to be a simple headless setup.
